# cprime

C front end compiler written in C.

I am using it for:
 - Create a transpiler, extending the C language with new features and generating C code.
   See it online http://thradams.com/web2/cprime.html

It also can be used for:
- Static analisys
- Refactoring tool
- Other language parsing (doc generation etc)
